QGIS 3.32 is a major release of the QGIS Project that brings a significant advancement in geospatial technology to the Open Source World. The developer community has introduced several new features and improvements to leverage the potential of geospatial data.

Amongst numerous quality of life improvements across a broad spectrum of existing features, the 3.32 release features the long awaited functionality for Native Point Cloud Processing in QGIS, allowing QGIS Desktop to become a powerful processing utility for LiDAR data.

This milestone achievement is thanks in large part to the contributions of the community to the effective crowd funding campaign which funded this development, the QGIS community and Enhancement Proposals used for the effective governance of these contributions, the collaborative efforts of the development agencies involved, and of course the extraordinary contributions of individual developers who build these tools for the benefit of all.

This release also includes a wide variety of developer experience enhancements, extensions to new functionalities like the profile plots and processing frameworks, and a new framework for sensor data to tightly integrate QGIS with data collection apparatus and facilitate the creation of next-generation intelligent solutions.

QGIS is a community effort, and we would like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate time, money, or otherwise contribute towards making QGIS more awesome, please wander along to QGIS.ORG and lend a hand!
